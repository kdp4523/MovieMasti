## 🔒 Security Practices

MovieMowa follows security best practices to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT tokens for secure user authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Role-based access control (User/Admin)
- Session management and token expiration

### Data Protection

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- MongoDB connection with authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for API security

### Frontend Security

- XSS prevention through React's built-in protections
- Secure API communication using HTTPS (in production)
- Input validation on client side
- Secure storage of authentication tokens

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be resolved before disclosure

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Never commit these sensitive files:

- `.env` files
- Private keys
- Database credentials
- API secrets

### Recommended Security Headers (Production)

```javascript
// Express.js security headers
app.use(helmet());
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
    credentials: true,
  })
);
```

### Database Security

- Use MongoDB Atlas or properly configured MongoDB instance
- Enable authentication
- Use connection strings with credentials
- Regular backup and recovery procedures
